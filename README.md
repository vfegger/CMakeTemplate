# CMakeTemplate
This project is a template for different types of compilation using CMake.

## Introduction
The intent behind this project is to make a standard guide for those who wish to use the CMakeTemplate as their main format.

This work will try to address the points in CMake Tutorial [1] and give complementary tips for static and dynamic libraries, multilanguage projects and more.
